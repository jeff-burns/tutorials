# Thunks, Sagas, and Epics, oh my!

## Redux Basics - Actions and Action Creators

### Actions
1. Simple JS Objects
2. Requires a 'type' property
3. Example: 
```
{
   type: ‘ADD’,
   payload: data
}
```

### Action Creators


#Thunks -> simple, ‘impure reducers’
Epics -> Actions In, Actions Out, requires understanding of Observables/RxJS
